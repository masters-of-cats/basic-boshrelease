# basic-boshrelease

A very very very basic BOSH release.

## What's this?

A BOSH release that can be used to quickly and easily to test assumptions about the BOSH/monit lifecycle.

## TL;DR Learnings

1. Make absolutely sure to include the `group vcap` line for processes in a BOSH job monit file
  * Otherwise BOSH essentially ignores the job and deployment will false-positively succeed
1. monit is quick (~1 second) to transition jobs to running once the PID file has been written
1. If a job takes longer than its timeout to startup the deployment can still succeed, assuming a). the canary/update timeout has not been reached, and b). it didn't take more than twice its monit timeout to start
  * We observed that if a BOSH job takes longer than twice its monit timeout to start, it enters a `Execution failed` state, at which point the BOSH deployment always fails, regardless of the canary/update timeout
  * We also observed that even though monit was reporting `Execution failed` for the job, the underlying process was actually running fine
1. Each time the monit timeout is reached, monit will start another instance of the process
  * In other words, it's totally possible to end up with multiple instances of the process running at the same time
  * We guard against this in garden by checking for the existence of a PID file and bailing out early if one exists

## Experiments

### 1). What happens when a BOSH job takes longer than the monit timeout to start

```
# configuration

* monit timeout               = 30 seconds
* startup                     = 31 seconds
* BOSH canary/update timeout  = 1000-100000
```

# analysis

* The deployment succeeds
* monit detects the job as failing exactly 30 seconds (the configured monit timeout) after the initial start
* It then calls start again (thus causing 2 x processes to be running at the same time)
* 32 seconds after the first start, monit detects the job as `running` (31 second startup time + 1 second to notice)
```

### 2). What happens when a BOSH job takes significantly longer (>= twice) the monit timeout to start

```
# configuration

* monit timeout               = 30 seconds
* startup                     = 61 seconds
* BOSH canary/update timeout  = 1000-100000
```

# analysis

* The deployment fails
* monit detects the job as failing exactly 30 seconds (the configured monit timeout) after the initial start
* It then calls start again (thus causing 2 x processes to be running at the same time)
* monit detects the second instance of the job as failing exactly 30 seconds (the configured monit timeout) after the second start
* 60 seconds after the inital start, monit detects the job as Started
* 71 seconds after the inital start monit reports the PID
* monit then sees the pid change (as the second instance finishes startup and overwrites the PID file)
```

### 3). What happens when a BOSH job takes just under twice the monit timeout to start

```
# configuration

* monit timeout               = 30 seconds
* startup                     = 59 seconds
* BOSH canary/update timeout  = 1000-100000
```

* The deployment succeeds
* similar monit logs to experiment 2, but in this case monit only detects the job as `failed to start` once
```

### 4). What happens if the monit timeout is longer than the BOSH canary/update timeout?

```
# configuration

* monit timeout               = 70 seconds
* startup                     = 65 seconds
* BOSH canary/update timeout  = 1000-60000
